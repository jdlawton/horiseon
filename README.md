HTML CSS Git Challenge: Code Refactor

For this challenge I was provided with existing code and tasked to enhance the pageâ€™s accessibility and refactor the code to enhance the readability, eliminate redundancy, and ensure that best practices are followed. The challenge also included setting up a GitHub repository for the project, following best practices, and ensuring the result could be viewed via a public URL.
